Arc Manta
===

Arc Manta Provides an [`Arc`](https://github.com/stavro/arc) storage back-end for [`Joyent Manta`](https://www.joyent.com/manta).

## Installation

Add the latest stable release to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    arc_manta: "~> 0.0.2"
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch the dependencies.

### Configuration

Manta uses SSH-signed timestamps to authenticate requests. You'll have to add some configuration to your application:

```elixir
config :arc,
  manta_user: "my_joyent_user",
  manta_ssh_fingerprint: "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:00",
  manta_ssh_private_key: "...an ASCII ssh private key added to your Joyent user's account..."
```

You probably want to load the private key from an ENV variable rather than hard-code it in your config.
